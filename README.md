# Algorithmic Problems

This is a collection of some problems I solved throughout my competitive programming journey. I've competed since high school and in my college years I qualified to several international tournaments, consistently ending up in top10 positions in Argentina and South America. Every problem has an explanation of the solution and the respective implementation.
